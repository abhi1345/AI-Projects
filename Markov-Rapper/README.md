# HMMRapGen
This program uses Hidden Markov Models to generate Rap Lyrics
The program was initially written by Ted Xiao and Siraj Raval, but I have created my own training data to tweak the model's output.

The lyrics used to train the model have been completely gathered by me.

This project is a WIP.
