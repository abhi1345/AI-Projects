Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesayâ€™s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

[Hook:]
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'm a die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (Keep doing it, I'm loving it)
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'm a give you motherfuckers is a dial tone

[Verse 1:]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
God damn, God damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic cup
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately you feel like I'm just not your sister at all, all
Uh, I'm sorry for calling and balling, I'm all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of the man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I'm me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for that guy he left and he ain't coming back
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting and selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
And Paris, what a beautiful destination
And perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say "how I'm your dad"
It gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you can stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Will you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm

Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, unemploying my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you
When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heart you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper and
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"

I wrote back and said: "of course I had sex before"
Knowing I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin

You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying, "God don't let me bust quick"
I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, cause

How did I finesse all this shit from Jane and Weston
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son tho
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds tho
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you , where you're from, where your bed at
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time tho
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know

Oh, and I'm back dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I got talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think he don't hear me
Hidden like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month, and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired
Cause I was inspired
By all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up
Gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking
The next weekend
We broke even
I made allegiance
That made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons
But still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. "Compton's human sacrifice"

If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
â€˜Cause I don't write shit, â€˜cause I ain't got time
â€˜Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em â€˜cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

A million here a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scaring nothin'
On some faggot bullshit; call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yeah, I ate a shy bitch, and she ain't shy no more
She changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch; so when she ask for the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass; you ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill; not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick; I'm it

They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
AndrÃ© 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say: "Life ain't shit without me."
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain; dare me!
Don't you compare me, â€˜cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me; I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

These are my one St Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low

Im in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant

People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us

Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up

Who you like, tell me who it is
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it i can't resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better

Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good
At the oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect you all to get

Im nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team in
Throwin up in a huddle nigga Willie beamin
Were still throwin touchdown passes
And tore his frame glasses
Hopin that someone catch it
People say that oh drake we started to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what yall want?

And my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions
Fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of essence
I'm allergic to comin in second
But I never sneeze
Nigga YMOE nigga yeeah

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap
Fuck wrong with you? What you was thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those
Boy I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so

I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told yah
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you thinkin'?
