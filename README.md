# AI-Projects
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Projects done for classes, projects, or fun.

Projects by Folder:
1) Stock Prediction SVM: Support Vector Regression models (linear, polynomial, RBF) which take in previous 20 days of stock data and predict the next day's high.
2) Movie Classifier: k-Nearest-Neighbors classifier which takes in string movie script and returns genre.
3) Puzzle-Solver: An A* algorithm, written from scratch, which can solve any sequence-based puzzle, like a sliding puzzle or word ladder.
4) Markov-Rapper: A hidden markov model I implemented in high school and trained with Drake songs to generate rap lyircs.
5) Superhero Classifier: A convolutional neural network I trained on images of my favorite Marvel heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Groot). Usually recognizes new images with >90% accuracy.
